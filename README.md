# Poetry Python Version

**This is a proof-of-concept work. Please add tests for your use-case. Thank you!**

This plugins reads `.python-version` file and sets the python version for the project where it is used.

## Installation

```bash
poetry self add poetry-python-version
# if you use pipx to install poetry
pipx inject poetry poetry-python-version
```

## Usage

If you are using `.python-version` file you might want to set the python
version for the project automatically. This plugin does exactly that.

It targets application developers that don't want to define Python version
in multiple places and their preferred way is to use `.python-version` file.

Once you have correctly installed this plugin and your project contains
`.python-version` file you will see following output when you run `poetry install`:

```
Setting Python version from .python-version file
Current Package Python versions: 3.11.*
Current PyProject dependencies Python: 3.11.*
New Package Python versions: 3.11.3
New PyProject dependencies Python: 3.11.3
```
